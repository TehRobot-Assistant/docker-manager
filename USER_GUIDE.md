# Docker Manager - Quick Start Guide

## Getting Started

**Access the panel:** {link}

**Your login:**
- Username: `{username}`
- Password: `{password}`

---

## What Can You Do?

Docker Manager lets you **start, stop, and restart** your assigned containers (game servers, apps, etc.) without needing full server access.

---

## How to Use

### 1. Log In
Go to {link} and enter your username and password.

![Login screen]

### 2. View Your Containers
After logging in, you'll see all the containers assigned to you. Each one shows:
- **Name** — The container/server name
- **Status** — Running (green) or Stopped (red)

### 3. Control Your Containers

Each container has four buttons:

| Button | What it does |
|--------|--------------|
| 📋 **Logs** | View recent output/logs from the container |
| ▶️ **Start** | Turns the container on |
| ⏹️ **Stop** | Shuts it down gracefully |
| 🔄 **Restart** | Stops and starts it again (useful if something's stuck) |

### 5. Viewing Logs
Click the **📋 Logs** button to see what your container is doing:
- Choose how many lines to show (50-1000)
- Enable **Auto-refresh** to watch logs live
- Click **Refresh** to manually update

### 4. Using Filters
At the top of the page you can filter by:
- **All** — Show everything
- **Online** — Only running containers
- **Stopped** — Only stopped containers
- **Group dropdown** — Filter by category (if set up)

## Common Tasks

### "My game server is lagging"
Try hitting **Restart** — this often clears up performance issues.

### "Server won't start"
If **Start** doesn't work, wait 30 seconds and try again. If it still won't start, contact the admin.

### "I need access to another container"
Contact the admin to have it added to your account.
